## Changelog

### v24.1.2 (62) (2021-04-27)

- Fix "Fix app interaction issues" not works on some devices (requires update app to v5.3.2 as well)

### v24.0.0 (59) (2021-03-23)

- Changes for Riru 25

### v23.8 (58) (2021-03-21)

- Explicitly check child zygote

Child zygote (`webview_zygote` and `app_zygote`) has no permission to use binder (this modules uses binder). Before only `mount_external != 0` is used for check, and child zygote do have `mount_external = 0` set, so there is no problem.

However, recently there are two modules, `riru-unshare` and `Riru-IsolatedMagiskHider` that changes `mount_external` for `app_zygote`. So if you are using one of these modules with the older version of this module, it will finally cause the crash.
